# 3D-Plot-Project
A Python script that uses matplotlib and numpy to create a 3D contour.

The script demonstrates how to create and visualize mathematical functions in three dimensions.

It includes the following features:

  >Generation of a mesh grid for X and Y values.
  >Definition of a mathematical function.
  >Plotting the 3D contour of the function.
  >Saving the plot as an image file.

Contents:
Counter_Plot.py: The main script that generates and displays the 3D plot.
3d_plot.png: An example output image of the 3D plot generated by the script.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have numpy and matplotlib installed.
3. Run the script using Python to generate and display the 3D plot.
